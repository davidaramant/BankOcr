# What is this?

An implementation of the [Bank OCR](http://www.codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) kata in fairly functional-style C# written for an [IndyFP](https://www.meetup.com/Indy-FP/events/258128927/) meeting.

Note that I "cheated" and ignored anything to do about input files; this takes in the ASCII-art account number as a single string.  File handling like they talked about in the description would be fairly trivial to add, just more tedious.
